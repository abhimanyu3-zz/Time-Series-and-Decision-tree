exploring the data avilable at LendingClub.com with Decision Tree and Random Forest

In this project I am exploring the data avilable at LendingClub.com. This organization is a very nice platform for connecting borrowers and investors. If i need money and if there is someone who wants to lend money then we can connect with each other on this platform. So, Obviously its your hard earned money and you would not want to loss it so you will invest this in someone who has a reputation of paying it back. In other words you would only want to invest this money to someone whose profile shows a high probability of paying back. I will be creating a model to predict those kind of profiles.
Lending club had a very interesting year in 2016, so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.
I have used lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from here or just use the csv already provided
